## python script:

I saved the script here for you to download:
https://github.com/erazo-janet/DataEng/blob/main/forally.py

forally.py



## install python for mac terminal here:

If Python is not installed , you will see an error message stating Python cannot be found

## Next steps
if it is installed,  ypu can try running the python script by saving the python file to your documents folder (your data.json file and your python script should botyh be saved in the documents folder) , and navigate to yourdocuments folder by typing 

cd Documents

then press enter

now you can see my path is looking at the documents folder.


## then to run the file, type:

python forally.py

then press enter 

if it works, youll see this message:

*since youre on mac, if that doesnt work, type this instead:

python3 forally.py

then press enter!
if it works, youll see the csv file automatically saved to your documents folder
